Whilst I've sucessfully used this application on my system, I make no guarentees as to it's performance for anyone else, and provide it as-is. I take no responsibility for any damage caused, whether directly or indirectly. If you're worried about what it does, please download the source, build it yourself, etc. (Also since I'm always interested in improving anything I've written, feel free to contact me with bugs etc, though it's a spare time project, so I make no guarentees on time frames).
